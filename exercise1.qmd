## First task

Here, I calculate the variance of the described distribution with the given formula.

```{r}
variance = 10 + 10^2 * 2
variance
```

Here, I plot the histogram and indicate its characteristics in the plot title.

```{r}
hist(rnbinom(n = 100, mu = 10, size = 2), main = "Histogram of 100 samples from \n negative binomial distribution with mean = 10 and variance = 210")
```

Here, I plot the histogram as above but use a log(x+1) scale on the x-axis. This transforms the data into a Gaussian normal distribution.

```{r}
hist(log(rnbinom(n = 100, mu = 10, size = 2) + 1), main = "Histogram of 100 samples \n from negative binomial distribution with mean = 10 \n and variance = 210 on log scale")
```
